## The Rundown
#### Lengthy Code Looks Intimidating:
Ever go back to maintain old files that maybe didn't quite feel excessive and chaotic at the time but clearly do now? Perhaps, then, the plethora of code didn't feel long enough to merit breaking into separate files. It happens. It felt right. But now, it's anarchy and it feels so wrong.

#### But It Doesn't Have To:
Directories allow easy file navigation without the use of additional packages.

By creating a directory at the start of each file, you can begin to portion off your code with section comments and index them up top. And with the use of special characters at the start of each section's title, you can easily "cmd + d" straight down to the needed section from the directory without picking up lines containing the same phrase.

Sections create space and focus.

By making section comments purposely "chunky", not only are blocks of code more easily found, but the distance created makes lengthy files feel less intimidating and more approachable.
